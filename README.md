Primality Test and it's Optimization

This is a suite of Programs programmes to show the effect of several fundamental algorithmic optimisations in finding primes and calculating the n-th prime. 

_01_naive.py starts with the fullyfully naive implementation and going through some optimisation steps to reach a trial division that only tests divisibility by primes.
